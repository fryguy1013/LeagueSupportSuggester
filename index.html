        supportReasons["Alistar"]["Lulu"] = "Alistar at his heart is an anti-engage laner, someone who headbutts/pulvs away when they attack your adc. Lulu crushes this playstyle because she can harass through his heal and if ali tries to go on her, alistar will have to get out of position to attack her and her lane will win the trade because of this.";
        supportReasons["Alistar"]["Zyra"] = "Zyra can pressure the alistar's ADC without him being able to do anything since zyra's presence mostly come sfrom her plants, which alistar cant protect his ADC from. Also if alistar attempts to go aggressive on zyra she can just e-ww and run away and alistar will be stuck there tanking plants.";
        supportReasons["Alistar"]["Janna"] = "First, Janna can interupt alistar's headbutt (and thus headbutt-pulv combo) which really hurts his gank-assiting potential. Also, janna supports her adc with shields/cc which leaves alistar unable to do anything and it turns into basically a 2v1 as most adcs outrange alistar's range (and janna is super far back).";

        supportReasons["Blitzcrank"]["Leona"] = "Leona counters blitz as when blitz goes in for a hook leona can actually go and kill their adc and tank with her W. Blitz however can still hook leona into a gank and kill her, so be careful.	";
        supportReasons["Blitzcrank"]["Alistar"] = "Alistar is great at nullifying blitz's strengths. If alistar is hooked he can just tank it or even turn it around if he is hooked into the adc, while if blitz hooks ali's adc he can protect by headbutting their adc away cancelling out his dmg. Also when it comes to ganks (which you should always call-for in a blitz lane), ali is great at setting up and turning around gank situations.	";
        supportReasons["Blitzcrank"]["Taric"] = "Taric has the tankyness and the cc to be able to stop blitz from being effective, as if he gets hooked he can survive and if his adc gets hooked he can save him with a stun + armor buff. Also in 3v3 gank situations he is a great facilitator with his hard cc and significant burst dmg.	";

        supportReasons["Janna"]["Blitzcrank"] = "Blitz is great vs janna because she excels at being able to \"stop approaches\" whether it be taric running up to stun or leona being kocked up while zenith blading. Blitz cant be stopped and pulls you in to their ADC a place you dont want to be.	";
        supportReasons["Janna"]["Sona"] = "Sona is a tough match vs janna because with her sustain and her harass she can win trades very easily. then since she can engage from a range with ultimaet it can leave you in the dust because it is hard to ultimate since the sona is far away.	";
        supportReasons["Janna"]["Nami"] = "Nami is similar to sona matchup but doesnt do as much dmg and has to pick her harass opportunities more specifically. However, she still has the harass-sustain combination that makes it tough for a janna lane, as you will usually go even in trades with the shield and their harass, but they will sustain up afterwards while you dont have that ability :(.	";

        supportReasons["Leona"]["Janna"] = "Janna is classic leona counter because her hard disengage and her ability to stop leona e with your q. Just be careful though cause if she catches you off guard (esp. before you get your tanky items like sightstone rush) you can get 1 shot. watch for level 2 cheese and level 6 cheese and you should win lane via protecting your carry.	";
        supportReasons["Leona"]["Alistar"] = "Ali is good anti-engage. If leona goes on you - stun / escape / ult. if he goes on your adc then headbutt their adc away and stun if necessary - cleanish disengage. Then with ali sustain you can hopefully win trade wars with your carries, but if they have a carry that just clearly beats yours (draven vs ashe per say) then all you can do is really just stop them from killing you, farm, and hope to win with ganks (which ali is great at facilitating) and such.	";
        supportReasons["Leona"]["Taric"] = "Taric is one of the few people who can go even with leona. if she initiates you can stun their carry and hopefully come out with an even trade. if leona goes on you you are tanky enough due to w and high base hp. most other melee supports dont have the combination of hard stopper and tankyness (nunu, thresh blitz)	";

        supportReasons["Lulu"]["Soraka"] = "Lulu's main strength is in her harass, especially at higher levels. Soraka is someone who scales up with levels and peaks at 5-7-9 similar to lulu. Soraka counterbalances this and can start to win trades for your lane.	";
        supportReasons["Lulu"]["Sona"] = "Sona has the strong trading potential to counter-act lulu's hyper-aggressive harass potential. Lulu will need to move up to harass your carry or to harass sona so this is when sona can Q and retreat, healing up in the meanwhile and over time will win more and more trades and can all-in with crescendo.	";
        supportReasons["Lulu"]["Blitzcrank"] = "Blitz's raw aggression from extremely low levels makes him counter lulu. with thresh or leona they only really start getting aggressive at the 6ish mark, while lulu gets her ult which can counter that aggression somewhat. but at level 2-3 lulu is defenseless, and this is where a good blitz pull can snowball the lane into oblivion	";

        supportReasons["Nami"]["Blitzcrank"] = "Nami's strengths lie in her ability to stop agressive laners from getting in range to hurt her, and winning trades with her poke and sustain. However, blitz undermines these strengths by being able to pull her into danger from afar, blazing past her strengths. And once nami is in close range she is very fragile and slow leading to easy deaths.	";
        supportReasons["Nami"]["Leona"] = "Leona's hard engage ability, especially after 6, puts immense pressure on nami and nami's ADC and if nami makes a slight mistake leona will punish super hard and once leona lanes get a tiny lead they will snowball it to hell.	";
        supportReasons["Nami"]["Sona"] = "Sona is good vs nami because she can sustain through nami's poke, however sona can not poke very effectively without putting herself in danger of getting nami bubbled, so it makes this lane a standoff. However, after 6 sona can all-in nami's lane and win easily after an even lane, and with gank pressure sona can crush even harder.	";

        supportReasons["Nunu"]["Sona"] = "Nunu is hard countered by sona because of her range and her high damage potential. If nunu ever tries to harass with snowball sona will just demolish the trade with her Q+passive dealing 2x as much damage as snowball, and having sustain on top of it. In all-in situations its even worse as sona will burst down nunu's adc before nunu can even reach sona's adc to snowball.	";
        supportReasons["Nunu"]["Lulu"] = "Lulu's harass not only essentially out-ranges nunu, but focuses the adc which leaves nunu's BB to shame and nunu's lack of trading potential makes him get crushed so hard by the harass of lulu.	";
        supportReasons["Nunu"]["Janna"] = "Nunu's strengths come in by being able to buff the adc and harass/tank with snowball. Janna can buff her adc even harder with shield and will bring more cc and damage to the table.	";

        supportReasons["Sona"]["Leona"] = "Sona is most susceptible to all-ins. Leona is the best engager starting from even low levels, blitz etc all are more situational and once leona hits 6 she has a strong long range reliable engage. If sona can su rvive that long and stay even then she can maybe fight, but that rarely occurs.	";
        supportReasons["Sona"]["Thresh"] = "Thresh has enough harass damage with flay and flay's passive AA dmg that Sona can never really harass effectively, and she has to be constantly on the defensive due to thresh's hook and all-in potential that Sona's presence in lane is crushed	";
        supportReasons["Sona"]["Blitzcrank"] = "Blitz can be aggressive from the start and if he gets 1 good engage on Sona then Sona's lane turns into a serious feedfest as she just becomes underleveled and so fragile that blitz is a constant threat.	";

        supportReasons["Soraka"]["Nami"] = "Nami has the perfect balance of sustain and all-in potential to counter soraka. Soraka tries to out-trade you with her heal? you have your heal and more damage than her. And you still have the potential to abuse soraka in an all-in engagement due to your high cc and speed up you can chase her down the lane easily.	";
        supportReasons["Soraka"]["Leona"] = "Leona can beat soraka because soraka is very weak at low levels (especially 2-4). Leona's power spike is at level 3 and if she can kill soraka then she can zone soraka's lane getting them SERIOUSLY behind and outleveled and thus crushing the lane even harder. Soraka doesn't have much to stop this leona level 2/3 all-in. However, something like a soraka-cait lane can beat leona by just shoving into tower 24/7 with piltover peacemaker and infuse spam.	";
        supportReasons["Soraka"]["Blitzcrank"] = "Blitz is strong pick against most sorakas. If he can get a kill early on her it is hell for the soraka lane. However, if the soraka goes REALLY heavy defensive runes, and gets a few points in her Q, she can win the matchup by baiting hooks and winning trades after getting hooked. However, this is a hard matchup non-the-less	";

        supportReasons["Taric"]["Nunu"] = "Nunu is perfect against taric for some reason, although nunu isnt the best most viable support atm if he gets a support-oriented buff he would be great pick. Taric cant stun nunu or else they will get owned, and nunu can buff the carry so he will kite taric's poor approach.	";
        supportReasons["Taric"]["Zyra"] = "Tarics burst potential was nerfed so more squishy supports who can stop his approach became more viable. zyra is great at stopping him when he tries to move up and stun someone with her e-ww combo. and in hard engagements you ult and gggggg - taric excels at these long engagements due to his auras.	";
        supportReasons["Taric"]["Nami"] = "Nami is decent vs taric because his burst was nerfed hard. and she can stop him when he approaches to stun with your Q, that is what you want with nami someone to run up to you so you can land an easy bubble and kite with slow attacks on adc. also you can heal up his small trades.	";

        supportReasons["Thresh"]["Lulu"] = "Lulu can stop thresh from being able to harass with her poke threat. she can also harass through creeps so she can stay relatively safe from the hook while still being a threat (opposed to like lux who has to shoot at an angle). If a hook hits (especially post-6 by lulu) she can protect pretty easily with her ult knockup and the cc from w and her shield from E - although if you get behind early it can be a tough matchup.	";
        supportReasons["Thresh"]["Alistar"] = "Alistar can stop thresh's harass with his sustain, and if thresh lands a hook on ali it is not as big an issue cause he has high health, and if he lands it in your ADC you can headbutt their adc away and stun them to protect your adc.	";
        supportReasons["Thresh"]["Nunu"] = "Nunu can protect the adc if hooked by snowballing their adc which stops them in their tracks, and also is one of the highest hps in the game as a support so he is pretty tanky if he is hit himself. Also his bloodboil makes it a pain for thresh to try to hit hooks or to harass, if you have like a cait or vayne vs thresh nunu is perfect. Unfortuneatly nunu isnt great support at this point in the game - if he gets buffs or w/e for support nunu he can be viable.	";

        supportReasons["Zyra"]["Blitzcrank"] = "Blitz can get that early hook on zyra to lead to just snowballing .. but the thing is zyra actually has strong bush control so it makes it hard for blitz - not the most favorable counter matchups but one of the few supports who can turn a zyra lane into a feedfest	";
        supportReasons["Zyra"]["Soraka"] = "Soraka can heal her harass damage negating zyra's all in potential and she also can kill plants with her q which isnt too bad but isnt the best either. .. in general for zyra lane to win zyra hopes the opponents come up to harass so she can hit her easy e-ww, if they dont come up then she cant easily combo and the other lane can win over time. soraka aids this playstyle	";
        supportReasons["Zyra"]["Nunu"] = "Nunu can eat the plants (he should get a special buff from his newfangled q shouldnt he? :P) and the bloodboil makes it so it is easier for your carry to dodge. also this will help your carry win 1v1 trades with their ADC when the zyra cant get there in time cause shes slow as an old woman.	";

        supportReasons["Fiddlesticks"]["Thresh"] = "Thresh is perfect against fiddle because he can counter-trade the early crow harass from fiddle, abuse fiddle's squishyness with his hooks, and disable the crap out of fiddle with his e-q-r.	";
        supportReasons["Fiddlesticks"]["Leona"] = "Leona can engage on fiddle pre-5 and kill them then snowball the lane very hard. however if fid can survive till ~6 they can start winning trades by fearing the adc if the leona engages. but it is a VERY scary first 5 levels, and she ends up usually winning :(	";
        supportReasons["Fiddlesticks"]["Janna"] = "Janna can abuse fiddle's poor approach (he is slow and has to get in close range to fear, janna can stop him with her long range spells, allowing for him to get chunked in the process). Also janna can ult his ult and just be very annoying to him.	";

        partnerReasons["Ashe"]["Janna"] = "Janna + ashe is really good counter-trade lane, they walk up to you, you volley + tornado / shield and they get punished and never walk up to you again!";
        partnerReasons["Ashe"]["Sona"] = "Sona + ashe is good harass lane, you can poke hard with volley + sona Q, good vs weak early lanes (something like kog)";

        counterReasons["Ashe"]["Blitzcrank"] = "Blitz good vs ashe cause she no escape and fragile.";

        counterReasons["Caitlyn"]["Soraka"] = "Soraka when she gets to about 5 starts just healing all of caits weak dmg, great if they cant punish you early.";

        counterReasons["Caitlyn"]["Blitzcrank"] = "Blitz takes cait's high control early and offsets it by just pressuring with hook - if you walk on a trap cait cant usually hit you cause if she walks up to you to hit you just hook her";

        counterReasons["Corki"]["Sona"] = "Sona's heal can lessen the effect of Corki's poke/trade during the early levels, and corki is susceptible to getting bursted at level 6 because of his low range.";

        counterReasons["Draven"]["Zyra"] = "Zyra can ww->e where draven's axe is landing, or just stop him in his tracks when he tries to be aggressive.";

        partnerReasons["Ezreal"]["Sona"] = "Sona ez classic all around lane, good engage with sona R ez R, good poke, good farm, good sustain.";
        partnerReasons["Ezreal"]["Lulu"] = "Lulu ez great poke / pressure lane, also you can blink on them with ez, start charge up on ult, and have lulu ult him for a cool combo.";

        partnerReasons["Graves"]["Taric"] = "Taric graves is classic burst, high trade. Can catch a support and 100-0 or stun an AD, chunk to 50-75, then zone or burst again.";
        counterReasons["Graves"]["Taric"] = "Graves is all phys dmg so taric's armor negates a lot of his dmg. Also cuts grave's trade potential.";

        counterReasons["Sivir"]["Nunu"] = "Nunu is pretty good because a BB ADC can harass sivir pretty hard, also snowball is short cd and really shuts down sivir, can go up and snowball --> force shield --> snowball again = gg.";
